thought process
scanning t00ls:

from ih
nmap ip (from proxychains)
./scan.sh
nc ip port
wget -r ftp://ip:portifyouneedone
wget -r http://ip:portoptional

on a device
one liner sauce (run on device in question to see what it can see)
arp -a ?

expectations for monday:
-----------------------
you will no longer have access to your internet host
take scan.sh
download online notes to local desktop
start by 0800
6hr exam, split in half
if you wget a file and its freaking empty, raise your hand

it will not be basic password anymore

for submitting answers, you have to combine the salt of the box and the actual answer to the question
we will submit questions using md5sum

mostly 3 attempts on questions

some will be multiple choice
you will only submit the letter
echo B | md5sum
those have 2 attempts

salt will always be in the home directory of the box

you ahve to find the creds in the environment for the medium and hard tracks
